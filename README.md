# AmadeusRelayServer
This is the Amadeus Relay API, which can be used by dApps who are interested in exchange ERC20 tokens.

Our API adheres to the [Standard Relayer API V0 Draft](https://github.com/0xProject/standard-relayer-api) as provided by the 0x team. 

## For Developers

To start contributing to Amadeus Relay API, clone the git repo and type:
```
npm install
```

To build locally:
```
npm run build
```

### To run locally:

The command below will compile and start dev server:
```
npm run start:dev
```

If the code is open on Visual Studio Code, a debugger process can be attached by going to VS Code Debug View (fourth icon from top on the menu on the left) and click on the play icon.

It requires a local ethereum node to be running on `"http://" + process.env.ETHEREUM_NODE + ":8545"`.

All configuration resides on `./config/default.json`. On this file is possible to set all tradable tokens, set their trade prices, and change the main relayer wallet address.

### To run on cloud:

Accessing your Goggle Cloud Paltaform Console.

- Create a cluster (if you don't have one)

** Choose a machine (1 vCPU, 2 Gb)
** Choose cluster size (2)

- Activate the Google Cloud Shell
* Click the icon ">_" on the top right
* A console will be opened

- Get credentials to access the cluster
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials amadeus-server --zone europe-west1-b
```

- Clone the repository and checkout the specific branch (if necessary)
```
git clone https://github.com/AmadeusRelay/AmadeusRelayServer.git
cd AmadeusRelayServer
git checkout [branch_name]
```

* Run build command
```
docker build -t amadeus-relay-server .
```

- Create a tag container
```
docker tag amadeus-relay-server eu.gcr.io/amadeusrelay/amadeus-relay-server:v1
```
* "amadeusrelay" is the project name
* the project name must be lower case

- Push the container to the Google Cloud docker repository
```
gcloud docker -- push eu.gcr.io/amadeusrelay/amadeus-relay-server:v1
```

- Run the application on cloud
```
kubectl run amadeus-relay-server --image=eu.gcr.io/amadeusrelay/amadeus-relay-server:v1 --port 3000
```

- Expose to Internet
```
kubectl expose deployment amadeus-relay-server --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 3000
```

- Scale up your application

kubectl scale deployment amadeus-relay-server --replicas=2
```

It's ready !!!
